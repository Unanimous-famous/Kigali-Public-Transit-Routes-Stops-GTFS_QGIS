# 🚌 Kigali Public Transit Routes & Stops (GTFS in QGIS)

This project was developed by following the [**Data Fundamentals for Sustainable Mobility**](https://transformative-mobility.org/training/transport-data-for-sustainable-mobility/) online course offered by the **Transformative Urban Mobility Initiative (TUMI)** on [**FutureLearn**](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/data-fundamentals-for-sustainable-mobility/1/welcome).

## 🗺️ Project Summary

Using **GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification)** data, the public transport **routes and stops in Kigali**, the capital of Rwanda, were visualised and analysed in **QGIS**.

The GTFS dataset includes bus stops, route shapes, trip information, and schedules — enabling spatial analysis and transport mapping within an open-source GIS environment.

## 📦 Data Source

The dataset was obtained from **TUMI's GTFS Hub**, which provides open transit datasets for cities across the Global South.
